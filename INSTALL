Moth Hamster Wheel



linux instructions:
#cmake CMakeLists.txt
#make
./mothHamsterWheel locally from there

windows mingw instructions: --NOTE: this is not supported yet!

set your local user PATH to your mingw/bin folder. Add it if it doesnt exist
#cmake CMakeLists.txt -G "MinGW Makefiles"
#mingw32-make


Currently this compiles in Linux out-of-the-box

Techinically It should have no issues compiling with mingw,
 However It's reccomended to get a dll or .a file to link with. This should be in the main distro soon.
